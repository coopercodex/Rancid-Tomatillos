  ## Introduction

   This project was a solo project that I completed in the first weeks of learning React! Although it was chellenging i learned alot on how the workflow and planning is extremely important to the success of a project. From fundamental React to getting in some good logic this project was very enjoyable as React makes a developers job easier!

  ## Technologies

  - Javascript
  - React
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Cypress
  - Webpack
  - Router
  - XML


  ## Features

  This application takes in and manipulates movies data from an api to make a fully functional website simialar to IMDB or Rotten Tomatoes. You can scroll movies and click different features for a user friendly and active website experience. From a auto scroller of the highest rated movies to a details page with that movies trailer it provides an 'array' of features!

  ## Possible Future Extensions

  Some future extensions i want to pursue is adding a search bar as well as a generes filter to this site.

  ## Set Up
  1. Fork and clone this repo.
  2. Type `cd` to move into the root directory.
  3. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. Have Fun!
